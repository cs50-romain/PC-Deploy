# What should it do?
PCDeploy will make a usb ready to setup a computer from start to finish, depending on if correct network.
    - Here is what it will deploy:
        * autounattend.xml
        * windows client to connect to server
        * powershell scripts and its dependencies
        * oobe package if necessary
It can be used for other things, like create a autounattend.xml file, starting the server to listen for client connection.
